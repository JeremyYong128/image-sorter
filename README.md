# Image Sorter

A simple app to sort images more quickly than dragging and dropping. Currently only supports command-line startup and MacOS (recovering file from trash only implemented on Mac).

To get started, a Python installation is required. Then, run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JeremyYong128/image-sorter.git
cd image-sorter
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Future Improvements

Several ideas for additional features:

* Packaging into DMG/exe applications
